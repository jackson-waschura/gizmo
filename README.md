## Motion Graphics

`gizmo/mg` enables the creation of motion graphics in GDScript. These are animations which are rendered in 2D and saved as a video.

### Code Block

The `CodeBlock` node is a custom node that displays a block of code with syntax highlighting and a title. It currently supports GDScript highlighting but adding new languages is relatively simple.
